It is a common use case for time series modelling to need to estimate many 
related, but slightly different time series at the same time. As you can imagine 
it soon becomes inpractical to use ``` ARIMA```, as you would need to manually analyze 
the ACF/PACF graphs for each process, apply different seasonality/differencing 
to stationarize the data, and find the appropriate order for each time series. 

In this tutorial I will highlight the limitiations of training ``` Auto.Arima``` 
models in a loop and walk through a simple implementation of a Vector Autoregression
model (VAR) using the ``` vars``` package in R. 

```{r install.packages,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
packages <- c('Quandl','forecast','ggplot2','tseries')

UsePackages <- function(p) {
  if ( !is.element(p, installed.packages()[,1]) ) {
    install.packages(p, dep = TRUE)}
  require(p, character.only = TRUE)}

for (p in packages) {UsePackages(p)}

```

With a VAR model we are attempting to capture not only the autocorrelation of 
a individual time series (eg. series A), we are also trying to model the 
correlation between Series A and other time series. As you could imagine this 
is particularily useful in economics and financial use cases, where many different
time series are related and all impact eachother.

For this example I am going to use some basic economic indices from the ``` Quandl``` 
package. This package allows 50 api calls a day, but you can get more by registering 
for an API key.

```{r Load Data from Quandl}
#GDP, consumer confidence, volatility, S&P500, unemployment
api_key = '3rogaghy3Qf5KmQs_CAk'
Quandl.api_key(api_key)

#Load data sources
gdp = Quandl('FRED/GDP','ts',start_date = '1960-1-1',end_date='2015-01-01')
unemp = Quandl('FRED/NROUST','ts',start_date = '1960-1-1',end_date='2015-01-01')
s_p = Quandl('YALE/SPCOMP','ts',collapse = 'quarterly',start_date = '1960-1-1',end_date='2015-01-01')
#subset the columns
cpi = s_p[,4]
int_rate = s_p[,5] 
pe_ratio = s_p[,9]
s_p = s_p[,1]
house_st = Quandl('FRED/HOUSTNSA','ts',collapse='quarterly',start_date = '1960-1-1',end_date='2015-01-01') 

```



```{r GDP Data, fig.height=4,fig.width=6}
autoplot(gdp)
    #Clearly an exponential trend in GDP, lets remove with the Box Cox transformation
autoplot(BoxCox(gdp,lambda=.35))
    # A bit better now, at least in the later years of analysis
```


Now that we've removed the exponential trend we can look at stationarizing.

```{r Differencing GDP}
autoplot(diff(BoxCox(gdp,lambda=.35)))
    #First order difference appears relatively stationary and mean reverting
adf.test(diff(BoxCox(gdp,lambda=.35)))
    #   ADF test has significant evidence to reject the Null hypothesis of 
    #    a unit root is present (if there is another random walk component)

gdp_diff = diff(BoxCox(gdp,lambda=.35))
```


 Now to try to stationarize the Unemployment rates
```{r}
autoplot(unemp)

autoplot(diff(ts(unemp,frequency = 4),differences=2))
    # Second order differences look to stationarize this ts
```



```{r}
autoplot(s_p)
autoplot(house_st)
```
```
